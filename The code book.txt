LITERATURE REVIEW AND CHOICE OF VARIABLES

Since 1990, the HDI has been chosen by the UNDP to capture human development. We therefore retain the HDI
(idh) as the variable of interest.
Note also that the HDI is in the form of a number between 0 (terrible) to 1 (excellent). It allows
a categorization of countries into four classes, those said to have very high human development (𝐼𝐷𝐻> 0.8), those said to have high human development (0.7 ≪ 𝐼𝐷𝐻 ≪ 0.799), those said to have medium human development (0.55 ≪)
𝐼𝐷𝐻 ≪ 0.699) and lastly countries with low human development (𝐼𝐷𝐻 <0.550) 2
.
Based on the work of Klugman as well as some researchers, since 2011 the HDI has been calculated by integrating three
dimensions, in this case, the health of the population that we capture by the number of doctors per 1000
inhabitants (med) and health expenditure (expenditure); education, captured by the average length of schooling
(durmoysco) and the expected duration of schooling (durattensco); and the standard of living, captured by the national income
gross per capita (rnbparhab). In addition, the work of Arcelus Sharma and Srinivasan (2005) highlights
variables such as foreign direct investment (FDI), access to electricity (accelec), internet access
(utilinter). Finally, we added the unemployment rate (unemployment) intuitively and given the context
African.
