ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study is to identify the determinants of human development in an African country in 2017. 
We use the UNDP HDI to measure this level of development. 
Based on the work of Klugman (2011), Arcelus, Sharma and Srinivasan (2005),
we first regressed the HDI on 9 exogenous indicators; to retain only 4 in the end 
Gross national income, access to electricity, average length of schooling and expected length of schooling). 
Our model explains 91% of the variability in the level of human development in these countries. 
However, it is observed that the HDI increase due to an increase in the average length of schooling is the 
same in countries having experienced armed conflict or not. Also, the fact that a country has the CFA franc as 
its currency or that it is a member of CEMAC does not enrich the model.
